Initiates the password reset process by sending a reset link to the provided email address.

If the email address is associated with an existing user account, an email containing a secure password reset link will be sent.
This link allows the user to reset their password securely.

### üîπ Expected Flow:
1. User submits their email address.
2. If valid, a reset link is generated containing a unique token and encoded user ID.
3. The reset link is sent to the user's email address.
4. User can follow the link to set a new password.

### üîπ Security Considerations:
- **No user enumeration risk** ‚Üí Response is **always `200 OK`**, even if the email is invalid.
- **Time-limited reset links** ‚Üí Tokens expire after a predefined period.
- **Rate-limited requests** ‚Üí Too many reset requests result in **`429 Too Many Requests`**.
- **Tokens are cryptographically secure** ‚Üí Prevents unauthorized access.

Completes the password reset process by validating the provided **UID**, **reset token**, 
and **new password** fields.

This endpoint is used after the user clicks on the password reset link sent to their email. 
The link contains a unique **token** and **encoded user ID (UID)** which must be submitted along with 
the new password.

### üîë Expected Flow:
1. User clicks on the reset password link received via email.
2. The frontend collects and submits:
   - `uid`: Encoded user ID from the link.
   - `token`: Password reset token from the link.
   - `password`: New password to set.
   - `retyped_password`: Confirmation of the new password.
3. Backend verifies the token and UID, checks password match, and resets the user's password.

### üîí Security Considerations:
- The **token** and **UID** ensure that only the rightful account owner can reset the password.
- Password validation uses Django's built-in validators to enforce strong passwords.
- **Throttle classes** are applied to this endpoint (with a rate of 10/hour by default) to mitigate 
  brute-force attempts against the password reset confirmation process.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Notes:
- Both `password` and `retyped_password` must be identical.
- The `token` is **time-limited** and becomes invalid after use or expiration.
- On success, a confirmation message is returned. On failure, error details are provided.
